# Python Collection Tool
## Project Overview
This project is a simple collection management tool built in Python with an SQLite database.

This was my first Python project, built as a learning exercise.
It is not polished, and the structure could be improved significantly (imports, path handling, UI design, database logic, etc.).
If I were to revisit it, I would likely rebuild it from scratch, possibly in Java or another language.
